### Quid Pro Quo
I will **promote my presence at your conference** before, during and afterwards. I will **deliver an up-to-date and unique talk** that is valuable to the audience. I will **stay inside the timebox** for my talk and handle Q&A in the predefined manner.  I will be **well-prepared and punctual for tech checks**. I will bring my own laptop, clicker and video adapter. I will **socialize at warmups, birds of a feather and speakers' dinner**. I will **mingle with attendees** during the conference and answer questions. I will **publish and promote my slidedeck and recordings** after the conference. I will help ** facilitate sponsoring opportunities**. I will be friendly, professional and help to **uphold the conference's Code of Conduct**.

I expect you to **promote my talk** before, during and after the conference. I expect you to **have a working stage setup** with mic and projector. I expect you to have a **Code of Conduct** for the conference that you can enforce. I'd like you to **record and publish my talk.** I'd like you to **pay for travel and boarding** unless we've agreed otherwise. I'd like you to **inform me on tech setup** such as projector resolution, headset etc. I'd like you to **reply to my emails** in a timely fashion. I wish you'd **not hand out useless swag**. I wish you'd have **conference t-shirts available in women's fitted cut**, too. I wish you'd have an inclusive **scholarship program** to foster diversity.
